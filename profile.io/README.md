## Technical Approach

We'd like to use Aztec ZKP for proving adult verification on our app.
We have already smart contract that mints NFTs on Polygon mainnet and the plan is to use create ZKP when user prove his/her identity including age then the user can use other places wherever age verification is required without revealing details.

## Expected Outcomes
Providing a quick age verification feature.
