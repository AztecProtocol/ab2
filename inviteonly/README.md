# Invite only

This project is for proving you have received an invitation by email to an event.

Your identity is kept private by utilizing the ZK capabilities of zkEmail and Aztec.

## Challenge Selection
The selected challenge is "zkEmail Guardian".

## Team information

Lauri Peltonen, ZK developer.

## Technical Approach

Utilize zkEmail to prove that the user has received an email from a certain email address and that the email includes a certain keyword.

If time, create a minimal frontend.

## Expected Outcomes

A way for anyone to prove that they are invited to an event, without exposing their email address. If time permits, a crude website to demonstrate - otherwise interaction through CLI.
