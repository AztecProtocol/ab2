# Invite only

This project is for proving you have received an invitation by email to an event.

Your identity is kept private by utilizing the ZK capabilities of zkEmail and Aztec.

This can be used for either personal invitations, or even for larger organized events. Larger events could be from services like Luma. Proving an invitation for an event might be useful for requesting a POAP, airdrop or for getting an invite to another event.

## Unfinished

**NOTE**: this project is far from ready. Unfortunately, this project did not get much further than the drawing board - the idea was formed but not much was done about it.

## Challenge Selection
The selected challenge is "zkEmail Guardian".

## Team information

Lauri Peltonen, ZK developer.

## Technical Approach

Utilize zkEmail to prove that the user has received an email from a certain email address and that the email includes a certain keyword.

## Expected Outcomes

A way for anyone to prove that they are invited to an event, without exposing their email address. If time permits, a crude website to demonstrate - otherwise interaction through CLI.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- Time should be reserved for this kind of projects, properly
- This project's best takeaway (for me, at least) was getting to know the Aztec community a bit, learn how the system works and seeing what others are building.
- A lot of various incompatibility issues were faced, and those were documented in the parent project. Luckily, getting over those did not require much time.
