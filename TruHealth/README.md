# TruHealth

Nowadays many people try to search some information about their health on the internet. The issue is that the information most of the times is not accurate and can lead to wrong conclusions. This project aims to build a platform where health professionals can share information about health and users can trust the information because health professionals' will need to prove they really have knowledge about the subject of what they are talking about. To create trust in the information shared, we will build a skill verification system using email certificates. The platform will also integrate a reputation system where their clients can review anonymously their service if they prove they had a consultation with the professional. This will also help users to find the best professional for their needs.

This project can leverage Aztec's unique features by demonstrating a potential real-world application of privacy-preserving technology. The platform will create a trustless environment where users can trust the information shared by health professionals even if they don't know them, and they can be confident on having a source of truth about something that is so important and cannot be trusted from any source. It also creates a comfortable environment for users to review the professionals' service without the fear of being identified.
