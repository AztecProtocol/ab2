# Hairdrop

This projects implements GitHub prover status verification via zkEmail. It can be used to prove that you have contributed to a certain repository, without exposing your GitHub username.

Privacy is preserved for your username by utilizing the ZK capabilities of zkEmail and Aztec.

This solution can be adopted by any airdrop project - especially those focused on privacy. Certain GitHub users may not be willing to expose their identity for a regular airdrop, but if they can do it with real privacy, they are much more probable to join.

## Challenge Selection
The selected challenge is "Prove builder status - Prove contribution to a GitHub repo without revealing your username (ex through PR merged email) to claim airdrops anonymously" in the "ZKEmail Guardian" track.

## Team information

Lauri Peltonen, ZK developer.

## Technical Approach

Utilize zkEmail to prove that the user has received an email from a certain repository.

If time, create a minimal frontend.

## Expected Outcomes

A way for a developer to prove participation in a certain GitHub repository, without revealing their GitHub username. If time permits, a crude website to demonstrate - otherwise interaction through CLI.
