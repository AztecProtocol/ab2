# Offline Membership

The circuit and the helper contract to prove ownership of a valid NFT via a standalone proof.

It's a tool one can use for a wide variety of use cases up to verification of prepared proofs in a place that have no Internet connection at all. The project utilize quite a number of Aztec specific 
features: the logic of private NFT (for public the solution is trivial with just the look-up of the block of interest), leverage of the archive and nullifier trees tool, running Noir circuits on Aztec data stand alone.

## Technical Approach

Find the code at <https://github.com/skaunov/note_historical_offline>. (It was published as early as possible to enable other AB builders to use it; the code will be copied here on submission.)

The [README](https://github.com/skaunov/note_historical_offline/blob/main/README.MD) there is live and useful to navigate, also dirs have their READMEs with the relevant details.

## Expected Outcomes
Enabling a wide variety of use cases up to verification of prepared proofs in a place that have no Internet connection at all.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- What are the most important takeaways from your project?
- Are there any patterns or best practices that you've learned that would be useful for other projects?
- Highlight reusable code patterns, key code snippets, and best practices - what are some of the ‘lego bricks’ you’ve built, and how could someone else best use them?

## Project Links (For Submission)

Please provide links to any relevant documentation, code, or other resources that you've used in your project.

## Video Demo (For Submission)

Please provide a link to a video demo of your project. The demo should be no longer than 5 minutes and should include a brief intro to your team and your project.
